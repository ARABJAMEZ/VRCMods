Read the [Malicious Mods and you](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/blob/master/Malicious-Mods.md) doc!

Changes:
 * Advanced Safety: updated BundleVerifier to catch more types of corrupted bundles
 * FavCat: fixed some worlds not appearing in favorites. Re-fetch favorites via "More FavCat..." menu and restart the game to fix already-missing ones.
 * ScaleGoesBrr: fixed shoulders moving wrong if shoulder trackers are in use
