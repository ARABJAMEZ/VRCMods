Changes:
 * FavCat: Avatar search database will be much less greedy about including avatars in it from now on (this change is in line with public avatars API endpoint being removed).
 * Fixed IKTweaks and FavCat for build 1078 of VRChat

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.** Modding the client is against VRChat ToS. I am not responsible for any bans or other punishments you may get by using these mods!
