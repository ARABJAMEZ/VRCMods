This repository contains my mods for VRChat. Currently this is just JoinNotifier.


## JoinNotifier
A VRChat mod to notify you when someone joins the instance you're in

Current features:
 - Visual and audible notifications (configurable)
 - Toggleable per instance type (public/friends/private)

## Installation
Before install:  
**Tupper (from VRChat Team) said that any modification of the game can lead to a ban, as with this mod**

To install these mods, you will need to install [VRCModLoader](https://github.com/Slaynash/VRCModLoader).  
Then, you will have to put mod .dll files in the `Mods` folder of your game directory

## Building
To build these, drop required libraries (found in `<vrchat instanll dir>/VRChat/VRChat_Data/Managed` and mods folder, list found in `Directory.Build.props`) into Libs folder, then use your IDE of choice to build.
